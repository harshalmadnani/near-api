# Security Note:
# - NEVER commit real private keys to version control
# - Use test wallets with minimal funds only
# - Consider using hardware wallets or secure key management for production
# - The API is designed to accept wallet info via request body, not environment variables

# Render Deployment Notes:
# - Set these environment variables in your Render dashboard
# - Use Render's secret management for sensitive values
# - The PORT variable will be automatically set by Render
